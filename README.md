## 𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬: A Streamlined-Tech-Driven Solution for Market Abuse Detection and Advanced Analysis 🚨📊



Welcome to **𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬**, a project designed to detect market abuses such as insider trading, wash trading, and spoofing using SQL-based analysis. Built to simulate real-world scenarios, this project demonstrates how data analytics can enhance market integrity and prevent fraudulent activities.

### 📘 Project Overview
Financial markets are vulnerable to manipulation and fraud, potentially disrupting stability and eroding investor trust. As a Data Analyst at EquiAnalytics Inc., you’re tasked by the Risk Management team to analyze trading patterns for signs of market abuse. Using SQL, TradeGuard examines three datasets—**Surveillance Optimization**, **Regulatory Enquiries**, and **Market Manipulation Data**—to uncover patterns and anomalies indicative of potential abuse.

### 🚀 Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Detects types of market manipulation, including insider trading, spoofing, pump and dump schemes, and wash trading.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Simulates practical trading environments, providing insights into authentic market behaviors.
- **SQL-Based Analysis:** Executes SQL queries from basic to advanced complexity to identify suspicious trading patterns.
- **Actionable Insights:** Offers recommendations based on detected anomalies to strengthen monitoring and compliance.

### 📂 Datasets
The datasets used in this project can be accessed through Google Drive:

### 📊 SQL Queries and Analysis

**Easy Complexity**
- Calculate the total transaction value for each stock to identify the most traded stocks.
- Detect the top three manipulated stocks with the highest average order price.
- List the top five enquiry types and the users who requested them.
- Identify users with multiple regulatory enquiries within a single month to flag suspicious behavior.
- Cross-check transactions and regulatory enquiries with volume over 9000 for consistency.
- Link total order volumes for each stock with corresponding regulatory enquiries to detect anomalies.

**Intermediate Complexity**
- Track stocks with the highest positive price difference between consecutive months.
- Classify stocks based on price ranges to reveal unusual patterns.
- Identify users with more than three significant price fluctuations in enquiry data.
- Analyze top entities with high average order volumes, excluding extreme values.
- Highlight stocks with the highest percentage increases over a year.
- Detect significant price drops to flag potential manipulation.
- Flag orders with manipulated prices exceeding the stock's average manipulated price.
- Determine stocks with the top five transaction percentages and their shares of total transactions.
- Examine common market manipulation types and their average price impacts.

**Advanced Complexity**
- Calculate yearly price increases to identify stocks with growth over 500%.
- Detect users with notable price fluctuations across transactions and enquiries.
- Compute average manipulated prices for top stocks affected by insider trading.
- Identify cross-market manipulation patterns and estimate potential financial gains.
- Correlate volatility with manipulation tactics using manipulation and enquiry data.
- Benchmark monthly average price and volume against global trends to identify anomalies.
- Assess the impact on stock prices where post-manipulation prices significantly exceed pre-manipulation prices.

### 🧰 Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: The primary tool for data analysis.
- **Google Drive**: For dataset storage and sharing.
- **Excel/Google Sheets**: For initial data cleaning and optional visualization.
